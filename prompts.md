Ok, now go through the master-plan.md  file and build an execution-order.md file which is a list of execution steps of the plan in order. Make the steps as granular as possible such that an AI agent could write the python app iteratively with automated tests.  

Now go through each task in the execution-order.md file and write a task in the same folder with title: {{order}}.md. Copy the entire portion of that target task from the execution-order.md file into each task. Do this for all tasks without asking for permission to continue. Do it for all of them.

Now go through each task and expand them out. Use the Task Layout.md file as a template. Include deatils about everything that will be needed to perform the task. Include a strong definition of done including user stories and automated tests. Also include making a commit and pushing the code to origin in the definition of done.

Go through each task and split out to 1.xx  tasks if it can be made more granular. Each task should be as small and granular as possible so that each is easier to developer

Using the Software Developer instructions in the agents folder, iterate through each task in order and implement the task. There should be at least one git commit for each task. After each git commit, push to origin. Be sure to write automated tests and to run them before making each commit. Follow the safe testing practices in the Software Developer instructions to avoid tests hanging. Complete all tasks without checking in.

Continue using the  Software Developer instructions in the agents folder, to iterate through each task in order and implement the task. Start with the next task. There should be at least one git commit for each task. After each git commit, push to origin. Be sure to write automated tests and to run them before making each commit. Follow the safe testing practices in the Software Developer instructions to avoid tests hanging. Complete all tasks without checking in.
