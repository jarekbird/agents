Using the Software Developer instructions in the agents folder, iterate through each task in order and implement the task. There should be at least one git commit for each task. After each git commit, push to origin. Be sure to write automated tests and to run them before making each commit. Follow the safe testing practices in the Software Developer instructions to avoid tests hanging. Complete all tasks without checking in.
